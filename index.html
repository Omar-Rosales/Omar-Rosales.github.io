    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>Doctoral student and biomedical researcher who is passionate about healthcare and public health, especially pertaining to the use of biomedical informatics in disease control and prevention. My expertise includes project design and management, data acquisition, statistical analysis and interpretation, geospatial analysis, and developing and implementing research tools. I enjoy generating new ideas and devising feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems. My research experience has developed my ability to synthesize large volumes of information and ask critical questions about data. I am well practiced in identifying the best methods to answer research questions and quickly learning any skills necessary to deploy those methods. I am skilled in interpreting my findings within the context of existing knowledge about the subject matter and presenting those findings to both technical and non-technical audiences. Specific fields of interest include geospatial analysis, bioinformatics, and computational biomedicine. Previously, I have been fortunate enough to work with investigators at UTHealth, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, University of Arizona, Emory University and University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.</p>
